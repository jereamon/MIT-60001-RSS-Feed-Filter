# MIT-60001-RSS-Feed-Filter
This is my implementation of the final problem set for the MIT 60001 course.

The necessary code to access the RSS feed from Google News. I provided the classes and methods to organize news story information and designed several "triggers." The end result being that a user can set a "description trigger" or "title trigger" and if the description or title of a news story contains that trigger the news story will be returned.
