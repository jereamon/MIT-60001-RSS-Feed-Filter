# MIT-60001-RSS-Feed-Filter
This is my implementation of the final problem set for the MIT 60001 course.

The code to access the RSS feed from Google News was provided for me. 

I wrote the  the classes and methods to filter and sort news story information.

The end result being that a user can set a "description trigger" or "title trigger" and if the description or title of a news story contains that trigger the news story will be returned.

ps5.py is the file with code I wrote. 
ps5_test.py are a series of tests provided by the teachers to check if your program meets specicific functionality along the way.
